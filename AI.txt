There were a few AI promts to ChatGpt:
1) Write an example of a simple WebSocket controller with one method that updates user role. Use UserService.cs file.
2) Write xUnit tests for UserService.cs class. I want to use InMemoryDatabase to mock DbContext.
3) What is the nuget package name for BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword? is this a good option to hash passwords?
